ETNA is committed to be freely available to all readers.

Nevertheless, the publication of ETNA requires some money. In order to
be able to continue to make ETNA freely available as a service to the
scientific community, we would like to solicit financial contributions.
These contributions, in any amount, can be done by credit card (or check
in US Dollars) by using the link "Donations" on the left-hand side
margin of ETNA's website

  http://etna.math.kent.edu/

The acceptance of your paper, or its production schedule, is in no way
affected by your financial contribution (or its amount).

Other journals which are freely available charge over US $500 to all
authors.  Some journals, which charge subscriptions, make papers freely
available to all readers if the author(s) pays a fee of US $3,000.

We welcome any contribution, no matter how small or large.  Thank you in
advance for your donation.
