ETNA is committed to be freely available to all readers.

Nevertheless, the publication of ETNA requires some money. In order to be
able to continue to make ETNA freely available as a service to the scientific
community, we would like to solicit financial contributions. These
contributions, in any amount, can be done by credit card (or check in
US Dollars) by using the link "Donations" on the left-hand side
margin of ETNA's website

  http://etna.math.kent.edu/

The acceptance of your paper, or its production schedule, is in no way
affected by your financial contribution (or its amount).

Other journals which are freely available charge over US $500 to all authors.
Some journals, which charge subscriptions, make papers freely available to all
readers if the author(s) pays a fee of US $3,000.

We welcome any contribution, no matter how small or large.
Thank you in advance for your donation.
